# Google Community Mobility Data

This repository just holds the data that is updated by Google. They mention on their [website](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) that the data is from around 2-3 days before as it takes them this long to process it and so this repository won't be updating as often as my Apple Mobility Data [repository](https://github.com/nshyam97/Apple-Mobility-Trends-Data).

This data is being scraped using my Scraping with Selenium (Google) [repository](https://github.com/nshyam97/Scraping-with-Selenium-Google).
